# Yuna Liu
I am a doctor in economy and was a teacher in Finance and Banking, real estate finance, Mathematics and Statistics etc. 

Now I change my track to study programming in Python, running towards to be a developer in Artificial Intelligence(Ai) and Machine Learning(ML). 

My ambition is to be a specilist in Fintech after two years study and practice.
